{{% faqentry question="When Binance?" %}}
A Binance listing can cost up until 400 Bitcoin, which is about 3 million dollars. The foundation does not want to pay the listing fee. The foundation prefers using this money to pay engineers or to finance projects that build on Elastos to give Elastos more value.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="How much ELA does the foundation hold?" %}}
The core of the foundation holds more or less 3 million coins, which is 10% of the total supply. These funds serve to fund the operations of the foundation such as the creation of the Carrier network, the construction of the blockchain and the smart web and to pay the engineers.

{{% faqentry question="How is the foundation financed?" %}}
By the ELA they hold but also by the Bitcoin they raised during the private- and the crowdsale. Bitmain/Jihan Wu and NEO/Da Hongei are Angel Investors.

{{% faqentry question="Since how long does the foundation exist?" %}}
Rong Chen, the founder, already works on the project since 2000. Before the Elastos project was founded in summer 2017, Rong had a company called Kortide which worked on the technology behind Elastos.

Rong Chen was a senior engineer at microsoft before founding Elastos/Kortide and he proposed this solution to microsoft back in 1999. They were not interested. That‘s why he left microsoft and started his own company.

As long as there will be DApps to develop on Elastos he will continue investing in their development, be it with BTC or with ELA.
