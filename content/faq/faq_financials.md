{{% faqentry question="When Binance?" %}}
A Binance listing can cost up until 400 Bitcoin, which is about 3 million dollars. The foundation does not want to pay the listing fee. The foundation prefers using this money to pay engineers or to finance projects that build on Elastos to give Elastos more value.

{{% faqentry question="Since how long does the foundation exist?" %}}
Rong Chen, the founder, already works on the project since 2000. Before the Elastos project was founded in summer 2017, Rong had a company called Kortide which worked on the technology behind Elastos.

Rong Chen was a senior engineer at microsoft before founding Elastos/Kortide and he proposed this solution to microsoft back in 1999. They were not interested. That‘s why he left microsoft and started his own company.

{{% faqentry question="Can you give us more information on the creation of this investment fund? When will it be established? When can the community expect to see funding for the financing of DApps?" %}}
The investment fund will originally be around 1 million ELA. He also invested as an angel investor using Bitcoin (this is another investment). Jihan Wu is a strong supporter of Elastos and believes in the long term future of the ecosystem. As long as there will be DApps to develop on Elastos he will continue investing in their development, be it with BTC or with ELA.
