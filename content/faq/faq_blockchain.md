{{% faqentry question="What is a blockchain really?" %}}
It is a decentralized ledger. A way to make sure that every content stored remains accessible and unaltered forever.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="How do you run an application efficiently on a ledger? " %}}
It is not possible. All those so called DApp platforms therefore rely on off chain solutions which is just a fancy word for the internet. Everything that doesn‘t run directly on the blockchain is not secure and not decentralized. That is where Elastos is different.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="On which blockchain is ELA built?" %}}
ELA has its own blockchain. Its mainnet is live since December 2017.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Where can I see the ELA blockchain?" %}}
On the [blockchain explorer](https://blockchain.elastos.org/).
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Is the ELA blockchain decentralized?" %}}
Yes, Elastos merge mines with Bitcoin. Meaning it is as decentralized as Bitcoin and additionally it has a DPoS system to sign off every transaction.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="What is a sidechain?" %}}
It is a blockchain that can only function in the Elastos environment. Unlike projects with congested blockchains, DApps on Elastos use sidechains to fulfil their needs and approach almost infinite scalability. Sidechain can have their own token, smart contracts and be integrated in Elastos.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Yes but what is the sidechain on?" %}}
It is independent, it is a complete blockchain. Its characteristic is that it can only communicate with Elastos.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="What is a friendchain?" %}}
A friendchain is an independent blockchain outside the elastos ecosystem that provides atomic swaps or DEX capabilities with the elastos chain.

{{% faqentry question="Is there a lockup program?" %}}
A lockup program finished in February 2018. You could choose to lock up a minimum of 300 ELA for 1, 2 or 3 years. You would get an interest on your locked up tokens of +4%, 5+% , +6% respectively for the first, second and third year respectively (not compounding).
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Can I participate in this lockup program or a program to come?" %}}
No. There will be no other lockup program.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Why will there not be another lockup program?" %}}
For juridical reasons (among other because of the SEC).
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="How do the airdrops work?" %}}
Elastos ecosystem collaboration projects (dapps built on Elastos in collaboration with Elastos) have to lock no less than 2-5% of their project tokens published for converting into ELA. 20% of the project tokens (converted to ELA) will be used for Elastos foundation development. 80% of the actual project tokens will be rewards shared by all ELA holders. 
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="What is Elastos’ algorithm?" %}}
SHA-256 just like Bitcoin.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Can the ELA blockchain be forked?" %}}
The ELA blockchain is made not to be forked. Elastos developed their merge mining software with Bitcoin to prevent a fork. The DPoS system is added as an extra precaution against forking.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Nonetheless, nothing prevents the forking of this open source blockchain correct?" %}}
Yes but forking ELA offers little interest as ELA forks will be incompatible with Elastos ecosystem already in place.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Where do the transaction fees of each ELA transaction go?" %}}
The fees go to the miners.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="How will Elastos handle the scalability issues?" %}}
Through its mainchain and sidechain architecture.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="How does the mainchain and sidechain architecture work?" %}}
{{< internallink "Read this article." "/concepts/blockchain/_index.md" >}}
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Does Elastos have an equivalent to the ERC20 token?" %}}
No but it most likely will in the future once Elastos is fully released.
