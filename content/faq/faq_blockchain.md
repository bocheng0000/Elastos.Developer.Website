What is a blockchain really? 
It is a decentralized ledger. Nothing more, nothing less. 

How do you run an application efficiently on a ledger? 
It is not possible. All those so called DApp platforms therefore rely on off chain solutions which is just a fancy word for the internet. Everything that doesn‘t run directly on the blockchain is not secure and not decentralized. That is where Elastos is different.

What are the benefits of using ELA?
Users can use the ELA coin to get a decentralized identification (DID) and use this DID to buy things such as DApps, cloud storage capacity and a lot of other resources including digital assets and more. On top of this you can also invest in ICO projects and products on the Elastos platform with the ELA coin.

How will ELA gain value?
The tokenomics of ELA. 

Does Elastos have a wallet?
Yes, Elastos Wallet.
How to use the wallet.
The FAQ for the wallet.

Can I store my ELA on my Ledger Nano?
Ledger support is estimated for December 2018 or beginning of 2019.

On which blockchain is ELA built?
ELA has its own blockchain. Its mainnet is live since December 2017.

Where can I see the ELA blockchain?
On the blockchain explorer.

Where can I see the Rich List?
On this page of the blockchain explorer.

Is the ELA blockchain decentralized?
Yes, Elastos will merge mine with Bitcoin meaning it will be as decentralized as Bitcoin and additionally it will have a DPoS system to sign off every transaction.

Is ELA pre-mined?
Yes, 33 million coins were pre-mined by the foundation.

Is ELA an inflationary system?
Yes. ELA has 33 million pre-mined coins +4% inflation through AuxPoW+DPos: 4% x 33 million = +1.32million coins per year.

Why 4% inflation?
To compensate for the loss of coins over time, loss of passphrases resulting in loss of wallets, funding for the Cyber Republic, incentives for miners, compensation for stakers, …

Who gets the 4% of ELAs inflation?
From the 4% inflation, 35% goes to the miners, 35% to the stakers and 30% to the Cyber Republic.

How will ELA be mined?
ELA will be merge mined with Bitcoin through Auxiliary Proof of Work (AuxPoW) and it will also be mined through Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). More info about this in this article.

How much ELA is needed to stake through DPoS?
The DPoS system is under development for the moment. The DPoS system is scheduled for December 2018. No information is available on the amount of ELA needed to stake.

Is there a lockup program?
A lockup program finished in February 2018. You could choose to lock up a minimum of 300 ELA for 1, 2 or 3 years. You would get an interest on your locked up tokens of +4%, 5+% , +6% respectively for the first, second and third year respectively (not compounding).

Can I participate in this lockup program or a program to come?
No. There will be no other lockup program.

Why will there not be another lockup program?
For juridical reasons (among other because of the SEC).

How do the airdrops work?
Elastos ecosystem collaboration projects (dapps built on Elastos in collaboration with Elastos) have to lock no less than 2-5% of their project tokens published for converting into ELA. 20% of the project tokens (converted to ELA) will be used for Elastos foundation development. 80% of the actual project tokens will be rewards shared by all ELA holders. 

What is Elastos’ algorithm?
SHA-256 just like Bitcoin.

Can the ELA blockchain be forked?
The ELA blockchain is made not to be forked. Elastos developed their merge mining software with Bitcoin to prevent a fork. The DPoS system is added as an extra precaution against forking.

Nonetheless, nothing prevents the forking of this open source blockchain correct?
Yes but forking ELA offers little interest as ELA forks will be incompatible with Elastos ecosystem already in place.

Who can mine ELA through AuxPoW at this moment?
The mining software is not open source for the moment. Only Bitmain and its BTC.com mining pool (more pools will be added soon, e.g. antpool) can mine ELA until version 1.0 of the software is released, which is mid-2019.

Why does only Bitmain have this power for the moment?
For the moment, the system is designed like this to prevent the risk of forks until version 1.0 of the software is released.

Who will be able to merge-mine ELA with Bitcoin?
Every bitcoin miner that wants to install the software on its machine will be able to mine ELA with the 1.0 version of the software, which will be open-source.

Can I mine ELA?
Yes, as long as you are a part of Bitmains BTC.com mining pool. It is impossible to solo mine at the moment, in this alpha version. This will change when version 1.0 will be released. Note that in any case, the complexity of the process will be analogous to that of Bitcoin.

When is the beta version of the merge mining software with Bitcoin due?
The beta version of the mining software is due in December 2018.

Where do the transaction fees of each ELA transaction go?
The fees go to the miners.

How will Elastos handle the scalability issues?
Through their mainchain and sidechain architecture.

How does the mainchain and sidechain architecture work?
Read this article.

Does Elastos have an equivalent to the ERC20 token?
No but it most likely will in the future once Elastos is fully released.

What is a sidechain?
It is a blockchain that can only function in the Elastos environment. Unlike projects with congested blockchains, DApps on Elastos use sidechains to fulfil their needs and approach almost infinite scalability. Sidechain can have their own token, smart contracts and be integrated in Elastos.

Yes but what is the sidechain on?
It is independent, it is a complete blockchain. Its characteristic is that it can only communicate with Elastos.

What is a friendchain?
A friendchain is an independent blockchain outside the elastos ecosystem that provides atomic swaps or DEX capabilities with the elastos chain.

What is the use case of ELA, the currency of Elastos?
Elastos tokenomics.

What will I be able to buy with ELA?
	•	Cloud storage space (Interplanetary File System [IPFS])
	•	Digital goods (with their Universally Unique Identifiers [UUID])
	•	Computing Power if necessary
	•	Music, films, games and other kinds of scarce digital assets
	•	Services like domain name registrations and page rankings
	•	Applications built upon Elastos can use ELA for their transactions.
	•	ELA will be the principal payment method used to compensate developers for 
		the creation of DApps on the Elastos platform.
	•	Users can participate in the token sale (ICO) of a project, the presale of a 
		product or a funding
	•	And more…

Is a part of Elastos’ code copied from another project?
Some of the Onchain team members worked on both ontology and elastos early on to build the main chain code. This is why the main chain code for DNA and Elastos are similar. Keep in mind that these kind of practices are very common in the open source world and that the mainchain ELA is only a part of Elastos. Every sidechain and the development of the OS/Runtime/Carrier comes from original code and is way more complex.

What is a sELA?
It is a satoshi ELA.
1sELA = 0.00000001 ELA
