{{% faqentry question="Who can mine ELA through AuxPoW at this moment?" %}}
The mining software is not open source for the moment. Only Bitmain and its BTC.com mining pool (more pools will be added soon, e.g. antpool) can mine ELA until version 1.0 of the software is released, which is mid-2019.

{{% faqentry question="Why does only Bitmain have this power for the moment?" %}}
For the moment, the system is designed like this to prevent the risk of forks until version 1.0 of the software is released.

Every bitcoin miner that wants to install the software on its machine will be able to mine ELA with the 1.0 version of the software, which will be open-source.

{{% faqentry question="Can I mine ELA?" %}}
Yes, as long as you are a part of Bitmains BTC.com mining pool. It is impossible to solo mine at the moment, in this alpha version. This will change when version 1.0 will be released. Note that in any case, the complexity of the process will be analogous to that of Bitcoin.
