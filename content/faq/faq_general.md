{{% faqentry question="What is Elastos?" %}}
Elastos is a network operating system that works on top/in parallel, at the same time as a classic OS (Windows Android, iOS, …) providing a secure environment which permits access to all the applications and services of all the blockchains through a decentralized peer-to-peer network.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="What is a network operating system?" %}}
A system that uses the internet as a base layer. The internet becomes the device. This system is extremely well secured and peer-to-peer. Your data and computing power are both on your device and on the internet.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Is Elastos a company?" %}}
No, it is a non-profit foundation.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Is it an open-source project?" %}}
Yes, it is free and everyone can view the code on GitHub.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Who are Elastos’s competitors at the moment? And what makes Elastos different from others?" %}}
EOS is called a blockchain operation system, but its development period and open source codes are much shorter than Elastos’ 17 years. Also, EOS is dependent on its main-chain, so no matter how optimized it becomes, its throughput is limited. Elastos can extend the throughput infinitely with flexible main-chain and side-chain solution. Meanwhile, Elastos Runtime can deliver the trust function of the blockchain to a user’s application (like a cell phone, laptop, etc), which applies the blockchain to various scenarios in daily life.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="What is the biggest challenge for Elastos?" %}}
To make sure users can accept blockchain and understand the value of DApps, marketing development could be the biggest challenge.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="How are the work tasks allocated between Elastos teams in Beijing and Shanghai?" %}}
Elastos in Beijing is mainly responsible for the overall project operation and management in blockchain development. The Shanghai team works on OS development (Elastos runtime), including interface support with 3rd party applications. 
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Is there any impact from current government regulations?" %}}
No, Elastos private sales are not considered as a token sale by the Chinese government.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="When will Elastos publish English documents on github or other technical exchange platform?" %}}
We have started to publish ten million lines of codes on https://github.com/elastos and https://gitlab.com/elastos/CM12_0-Android501. Later, we will also publish the code on Reddit, Slack, Steemit and other platforms.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="What will be the future application cases in Elastos?" %}}
Because our vision is to provide users with a trustful operating system based on their application scenarios and as well as on blockchain technology, we will definitely have a lot of potential future applications.

The followings are some example of the applications:

* Support point-to-point conversation, point-to-point document transfer through decentralized P2P communication.
* Support point-to-point business through decentralized payment.
* Support digital content APP, like: electronic books, games, video player. All digital assets can be protected in a trustful environment.
* Support applications about evidence, traceability to source, ID verification, etc. through trustful storage.

Our projects that are currently in the business phase include: automatic driving system for one of China’s top automobile company, point-to-point document transfer system in personal mobile phones, evidence for credit investigation, single ID verification platform, and traceability of luxury goods.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Did anybody ask the similarity and difference between Elastos and blockstack?" %}}
Blockstack realizes a decentralized browser based on distributed storage, and supply applications depending on browser. It combines encrypted, distributed storage and blockchain ID to make sure all the data belongs to the owner.

As for Elastos, we will apply a similar method for digital assets storage. Users could apply for an ID for their digital assets on the blockchain, which guarantees the ownership of those digital contents. Based on the clarification of ownership, the digital contents will also be transferable and tradable. Finally, we make sure that all the digital contents can be used in trustful environment by the Elastos Runtime. Even though it is decrypted, it cannot escape from Elastos Runtime operating environment, which guarantees that it will never disclose or damage the ownership of the digital contents.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="What are the benefits of using ELA?" %}}
Users can use the ELA coin to get a decentralized identification (DID) and use this DID to buy things such as DApps, cloud storage capacity and a lot of other resources including digital assets and more. On top of this you can also invest in ICO projects and products on the Elastos platform with the ELA coin.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="What is the use case of ELA, the currency of Elastos?" %}}
{{< internallink "Elastos tokenomics." "/concepts/blockchain/tokenomics.md" >}}
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="What will I be able to buy with ELA?" %}}
* Cloud storage space (Interplanetary File System [IPFS])
* Digital goods (with their Universally Unique Identifiers [UUID])
* Computing Power if necessary
* Music, films, games and other kinds of scarce digital assets
* Services like domain name registrations and page rankings
* Applications built upon Elastos can use ELA for their transactions.
* ELA will be the principal payment method used to compensate developers for 
    the creation of DApps on the Elastos platform.
* Users can participate in the token sale (ICO) of a project, the presale of a 
    product or a funding
* And more…
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Is a part of Elastos’ code copied from another project?" %}}
Some of the Onchain team members worked on both ontology and elastos early on to build the main chain code. This is why the main chain code for DNA and Elastos are similar. Keep in mind that these kind of practices are very common in the open source world and that the mainchain ELA is only a part of Elastos. Every sidechain and the development of the OS/Runtime/Carrier comes from original code and is way more complex.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Does Elastos compete with Windows, iOS and Android?" %}}
No. Elastos will exist as an application (virtual machine) on smartphones and personal computers. You can utilize the new internet at the same time as your classic environment.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="What are the different parts of Elastos?" %}}
* An internet browser: Trinity
* A virtual machine: Runtime
* A network: Carrier
* A blockchain: ELA and its sidechains
* A platform that allows connection to other blockchain services: Ethereum VM, 
    NEO VM, etc
* An operating system: Elastos OS, for the Internet of Things (IoT), etc
* A system for distributed computing, elastic compute
* A system for decentralised storage: IPFS
* A completely secured environment
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="What is elastic compute?" %}}
It is a system for distributed computing that is shared peer-to-peer on the network.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="What are the benefits of using this platform?" %}}
Threats and undesirable activity on the internet, such as malware, DDoS attacks, man in the middle attacks, trojan horses, network surveillance (NSA, etc), theft and collection of all kinds of data (cookies, etc), theft of intellectual property, spam and more are all avoided by Elastos’  highly secure, encrypted and peer-to-peer system.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="What are the benefits to other blockchain projects to be of this ecosystem?" %}}
The benefit is to avoid all the dangers stated above.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Does there exist a project similar to Elastos?" %}}
No. No other projects similar to Elastos exists today. The only two other projects that use similar technology as Elastos are Amazons Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Alibabas Alicloud, which are both centralized projects. Elastos can also be compared to Chrome OS.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Are Ethereum, NEO, nOS, Cardano, EOS, Wanchain, Icon, etc competitors?" %}}
No. These blockchains and their applications are in theory all accessible from Elastos and could benefit from this new environment. 
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="What is the difference between Elastos and EOS?" %}}
EOS profiles itself as a blockchain operating system but its development time and its open-source code are way shorter than those of Elastos, which already exists for 18 years. EOS gives you a software development kit (SDK) to interact with the blockchain and uses different methodologies while Elastos is both an SDK and a runtime environment (virtual machine) that allows the DApps to function with an extra layer of security. EOS is also completely reliant on its mainchain so no matter how optimized it is, its capacity is limited. Elastos can scale infinitely with its mainchain and flexible sidechain solution. On top of that, Elastos Runtime is trust zone that uses blockchain as a way to ensure this trust.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="What are the similarities and differences between Elastos and Ethereum?" %}}
Ethereum has only one mainchain that is being pushed to its extreme limits in computing and scalability. Elastos proposes a mainchain and sidechains structure where the mainchain is solely responsible for ID verification and payments while the sidechains execute smart contracts to supports different applications and services. Ethereum has redundancy and network congestion problems.  The fact that all the data and code is placed on the mainchain causes a lot of data to be redundant in the primary storage. On Elastos the applications run in the Elastos Runtime. This method is more secure. All the data has to pass through trusted and verifiable channels. Elastos Runtime can come in multiple forms such as an independent OS, a virtual machine or a software development kit (SDK) that allows the integration of applications from other operating systems. On Ethereum, after the acquisition of the data, the DApps are executed on a user interface that can cause a risk  of exposing the data. Elastos is secured up until the hearth of your device. Because the DApps are not allowed to connect to the internet directly they are not subject to DDOS attacks.
{{% /faqentry %}}


{{% faqentry question="Why choose or utilize this environment to access blockchain services provided by Ethereum or Neo?" %}}
[Read this article](https://medium.com/elastos/elastos-cliff-notes-version-a305e92a7855)
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Why should the ethereum community work on making their own operating system when they can just use ETH smart contracts on Elastos? What‘s their incentive to do this?" %}}
The only value proposition of Ethereum is being a secure blockchain and having smart contracts. Now the ELA blockchain is even more secure through merged mining and supports not only ETH but also Neo smart contracts and every other VM can also be ported to Elastos. With Ethereum you are stuck with a single public chain which is prone to congestion like we have seen many times before already. Projects like ETH and BTC have proven to be very slow in adoption of new technology because of their governance systems, that‘s why there are hundreds of ETH and BTC forks/clones which no one is using.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Is it possible to access Ethereum, NEO, nOS, Cardano, EOS and more from the Elastos ecosystem?" %}}
Yes it is possible to access these blockchains and the functions they provide (e.g. smart contracts) once their VM has been ported as a sidechain onto Elastos. The original blockchain will then become a friendchain and atomic swaps will also be possible between Elastos blockchain and the friendchain.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Which blockchains will become a part of the Elastos ecosystem?" %}}
The compatibility with Ethereum and NEO, among others, is already in development. All the blockchains that will become a sidechain/friendchain of Elastos will be part of the ecosystem.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Who are the partners of Elastos?" %}}
Bitmain, META Union Alliance (avec BIT.GAME, Matrix AI Network (MAN), TrustNote (TTT), Achain, Aurora, and Elastos), IOEX, Weatherblock, Panda Green Energy, Origin Agritech, Reactor, HashWorld, Urban Catalyst & UK China Catalyst, Fresco, Huafu Group & Far Eastern Air Transport (FAT), Trust Credit Power (TCP), WeFilmChain, Zapya (Viewchain)…
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Elastos is completely open source, what is to stop someone from copying the code and releasing it themselves?" %}}
There‘s something called a network effect and we already have hundred thousands of nodes active on the Elastos smart web. Besides that we have a head start of 18 years of development and a team of engineers and a community working on Elastos. All those things can‘t be copied easily.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="What problems does this project solve?" %}}
This platform prevents more than 90% of the dangers on the internet, solves the problem of digital asset ownership and offers a certain amount of anonymity with an encrypted connection.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="How many applications will run on Elastos?" %}}
There are already 25 DApps (decentralized applications) in development on Elastos for financial services, medical care, Internet of Things (IoT), digital objects, etc; without taking into account the Ethereum VM and the NEO VM.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Is Elastos really decentralized?" %}}
[The mainchain of the blockchain, the sidechains, the applications, the data, will all be decentralized.](https://elanews.net/2018/07/09/community-writer-series-will-the-real-decentralized-app-please-stand-up/)
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="How many people work on the project?" %}}
For the moment more than 80 developers are active in China. On top of that you can add all the developers that are part of the Cyber Republic and are spread all over the world.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Does Elastos run on the Blockchain?" %}}
No, the operating system (a virtual machine) does not run on the blockchain because if it did, the blockchain and the network would quickly become overloaded and very slow. The blockchain will be used to verify identities and link the ownership of data to each identity. Ela will serve as a currency in the Elastos ecosystem.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="This is all good and well but it still seems really complicated." %}}
The foundation works on giving the user a pleasant user experience where possible. There will not be a lot of difference between surfing the classic internet and surfing on Elastos.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="This is all good and well but it still seems really ambitious." %}}
[There is an article called “Elastos’ Ambition”.](https://elanews.net/2018/05/15/community-writer-series-the-ambition-of-elastos/)
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Will each user have a name/address that resembles the complex addresses Bitcoin uses?" %}}
Yes and no.
[A DNS type service will allow each user to obtain a more accessible name and will replace the complex blockchain address.](https://elanews.net/2018/07/03/community-writer-series-elastos-did-the-backbone-of-the-new-internet/)
This service is called the Elastos DID for Decentralised Identity.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="When will there be an official wallet app for my smartphone?" %}}
By December there will be a mobile wallet that will work through the Trinity browser to store ELA and probably also the tokens of the sidechains.

{{% faqentry question="What is the Elastos TV Box? What purpose does it serve?" %}}
[Here is an article about the TV Box.](https://elanews.net/2018/08/08/elastos-tv-box-to-bring-1-million-carrier-nodes-by-end-of-year/)
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="What basic knowledge do you need to have to understand how Elastos works?" %}}
You need to have an understanding of how blockchain works of course (Bitcoin, Ethereum, PoW, PoS, smart contracts, etc) but you also need to know how the internet works (TCP/IP protocol, DNS service, firewall, etc) and have some basic knowledge about encrypted communication (PGP, private/public key, etc).
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Why use Elastos instead of another crypto asset?" %}}
Elastos offers an operating system that can be installed on any device in the world, giving its unparalleled security to desktop computers, smartphones, autonomous vehicles, virtual/augmented reality  (VR/AR) platforms, connected devices (IoT) and smart routers.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="I would like to know more about the development of Elastos. Where can I get more info and how can I get involved?" %}}
On [GitHub](https://github.com/elastos),
By visiting the [Cyber Republic](https://www.cyberrepublic.org/),
and feel free to directly contact Kevin Zhang, the head of the developers community.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="What will be the biggest challenge for Elastos?" %}}
This will not only be a challenge for Elastos but one for the whole ecosystem. To convince new users to accept blockchain and understand the benefits of DApps. As a community driven open-source project, the marketing towards developers will be crucial for the future of Elastos. We survive because of the community, we take care of the community, we listen to the community and even more so we work together as a community to build this ecosystem as best as we can.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="What is Elastos’ roadmap for 2019?" %}}
It is the Cyber Republic that will define the roadmap for 2019. It will be released in December 2018. Jihan Wu (founder of Bitmain), announced that he will work together with Elastos in creating an investment funds for DApps that will be developed on Elastos. 
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="What is the actual development status of Elastos?" %}}
* The Elastos smart web is in its alpha version.
* Ela is being merged mined with Bitcoin through Bitmain.
* The Cyber Republic is officially active.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="What are the future use cases of Elastos?" %}}
Because of our vision of giving the users an operating system they can trust which is adapted to their expectations and to blockchain technology, we will certainly have a lot of use cases such as:

* Peer-to-peer communication, sending files peer-to-peer through a 
		decentralized peer-to-peer communication system.
* Peer-to-peer business support through decentralized payments
* Digital asset support such as: e-books, videogames, videos, etc. All digital 
		assets can be protected in a trusted environment.
* Authentication of assets, ID verification, evidence/proof, etc through storage 
		of trusted data.

Our projects that are in the negotiation phase/being developed are:

* A peer-to-peer file distribution system for personal smartphones
* Proof for credit scoring
* A platform for simple identity checks
* Traceability  of commodities
* An autonomous driving system 
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Why migrate to Elastos?" %}}
Elastos is the infrastructure for a new internet, it offers a decentralized platform for applications, ownership of data, a virtual economy, scalability and ultimate security. New applications can be developed on it. Existing application will be able to integrate in Elastos and other blockchain projects can join Elastos.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="What programming languages does Elastos support?" %}}
C/C++, Java, Javascript and HTML5. The SDK will allow even more programming languages to be supported in the near future. An application on mac, PC, Android or Linux will be able to run on Elastos, the only thing that needs to be done is to modify it a bit so that it can communicate and be compatible with the network.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="What is C.A.R (Component Assembly Runtime)? Can I develop a DApp on Elastos with it?" %}}
C.A.R uses the C.A.R language. This is a new language developed by Elastos during the last 18 years. You do not have to know C.A.R to develop DApps on Elastos. It serves as a bridge between different programming languages.

It is very confusing to present C.A.R to the public which is why the foundation does not promote it. The only thing people need to know is that you can use Ionic and Javascript to develop DApps for the Elastos Trinity browser and soon using the React Native Framework. U can use the C++ SDK for the rest.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Does C.A.R use Java, Javascript or C++?" %}}
C.A.R does not use Java, Javascript or C++. It supports these languages. It will also support other languages. Because of these  languages, almost all devices will be able to use the services provided by Elastos.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Can I say that C.A.R is a proprietary language, a bridge language in which developers can identify different components, in different languages that can interact with each other?" %}}
You define the methods, classes, interfaces and specifications in the C.A.R. file and you can implement them in any language you want.
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="How is the work distributed between the team members in Beijing, in Shanghai and the West?" %}}
The Beijing team is mostly responsible for the general operations and managing the development of the blockchain. The Shanghai team works on the OS/Runtime, including interface support for third party applications. The Chief Marketing Officer and our community development team are mostly based in San Fransisco. More info here.

{{% faqentry question="You stated in the What is Elastos long summary section, “The Elastos OS gets upgraded when someone adds a new service …” . Please elaborate on what a service is in this context. How and where are those services added? Is there a formal code review or a vetting process before code is into ecosystem?" %}}

Services as in IPFS for storage, different modules such as spv wallet, carrier, DID, etc

{{% /faqentry %}}

{{< todo "Incomplete answer" >}}

{{% faqentry question="In the Developers Beginner’s Guide to Elastos, there is very little info on the SDKs. Can you talk about the function of SDKs and how they fit into the project development workflow." %}}

SDK is an Elastos Runtime SDK and this is targetted for different platforms such an android, linux, etc. The implementation is in C++. This is directly encoded within the trinity browser and through reflection, we can call on these C++ function calls from javascript. For native android apps, we can call on this SDK via java as a jar/aar package will be provided. For native ios apps, we can call on this SDK via objective c/swift(this is not 100% complete and is in development). For react native/flutter apps, we can create react native plugins and write the corresponding implementation in java/swift/objective c.

{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Some virtual computers that I ran on Windows or Mac had very limited device drivers. Does the SDK provide USB, pen, keyboard, and printer drivers, or do we have to wait for device manufacturers to provide those?" %}}

Currently, trinity browser uses cordova plugin to expose the underlying hardware to the elastos apps and this is for mobile devices. The plans for windows or mac have not yet been determined

{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Is there an SDK plug-in for popular IDEs like; PyDev, Aptana, Visual Studio, etc.?" %}} 

It’s a C++ SDK so this can be extended to be used from python, golang, etc. However, no plugin available for IDEs yet. Maybe in the future

{{% /faqentry %}}

{{< todo "Not right? Ex: On android, developers use a android sdk, not the C++ native part" >}}

{{% faqentry question="Is there a difference between the terms ecosystem and platform in relation to Elastos?" %}}

Platform usually refers to a set of SDKs and APIs that are provided that can be used to interact with ALL the services within the Elastos Network Operating System. An ecosystem extends way beyond that as it also refers to community governance and how the project is run

{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Are core coders working from a formal design specification?" %}}

Depends what project. Elastos has a lot of repositories. Eg. runtime, carrier, blockchain. And then there are 45+ other repos on github. The core code for the infrastructure is likely derived from a formal design specification (it’s all done internally as a team)

{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Is a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) in Elastos an asynchronous call?" %}}
This is a synchronous call
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Are SDKs written for specific language like C++, Python, and Java?" %}}

It’s a C++ SDK so this can be extended to be used from python, golang, etc. For android, a corresponding JAR is created, etc.

{{% /faqentry %}}

{{< todo "Need to improve this answer" >}}


{{% faqentry question="Does Elastos have error logging to capture bugs or abnormal events occurring in core code or carrier hardware?  If errors and events are logged, to whom are logs sent?" %}}

For elastos carrier sdk (normal carrier node side),  application can get running logs by calling API ela_log_init(), and application (or upperlayer) can integrate those logs to their log systems; For elastos bootstrap node, all running logs would be output to syslog facility

{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Does Elastos use any 3rd party code snippets, libraries, or source code?" %}}

Depends what project. Trinity browser is based on chromium. Carrier uses lots of 3rd party libraries. Elastos mainchain is based on PoW but merged mined so it borrows a lot of ideas from namecoin (that is also merged mined with bitcoin). The elastos runtime however is unique to elastos and is home grown

{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Who is testing SDK libraries for bugs?" %}}
The core internal team and then 3rd party for audits
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="How is code updated if bugs are found in release version?" %}}

Elastos Carrier serves as a way to automatically provide update services remotely in a decentralized manner. Eg. IoeX. Most of the calls being made from elastos apps are RPC calls so usually, if a bug is found within the blockchain code or carrier code, this can be automatically updated and pushed out similar to how bitcoin code is updated. If there’s a bug in trinity browser itself(the runtime code), then a new version of the app needs to be pushed out via app store

{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Is there a bug bounty?" %}}

Yes, certainly. The process is still being determined however

{{% /faqentry %}}

{{< todo "Out of date answer ?" >}}

{{% faqentry question="Will there be bug tracking outside of the github repository?" %}}

Unlikely. We’ll be using github for bug tracking. Maybe integrate github issue API to cyberrepublic.org someday but that’s not anytime soon

{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Who decides when to publish code updates?" %}}
At the moment, the elastos foundation
{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Are user preferences for Elastos Dapps stored and loaded from local memory or is this done through IPFS?" %}}

IPFS is still in development so at the moment, it’s all loaded from local memory

{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="There is a security vulnerability created by office printers, fax machines, and scanner-copiers. The problem is that data you send to these devices are stored on in drives in these devices and can be hacked for the data. Given that some Elastos apps will use these devices, can any part of Elastos prevent those devices from being hacked?" %}}

Elastos apps run inside elastos runtime environment so this means that data will never get out of this sandbox environment so you won’t be able to print from elastos dapps at all nor store them in these devices unless they have elastos carrier in them and are acting as a node that stores data. In which case, the data would not leak either as everything is encrypted

{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Did Elastos implement a customized version of the IPFS protocol and embed it into the Elastos kernel or is Elastos using a plugin from a third party implementation?  If third party, what maintenance and a security risks does that create?" %}}

This is currently in development

{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="In the event some nodes are unavailable, how does Elastos provide redundancy so data are available and not permanently lost?" %}}

This is in development but this is more of an engineering problem and can always be modified later. Maybe one solution is to provide a redundancy of 10 at all times so the data is more resilient and more fault-tolerant

{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Is it true that most projects like EOS, Cardano, Ethereum, can run as side chains on Elastos?" %}}

Yes, Neo and Ethereum are currently being ported as sidechains to elastos. This can be done to any smart contract platforms

{{% /faqentry %}}

{{% faqentry question="Is it true that Elastos is the first project to provide security, decentralization, scalability, and interoperability for the crypto space?" %}}

Security: Merge mining with bitcoin, Decentralization: decentralized carrier and storage, interoperability: DID system, smart contracts as sidechains, etc

{{% faqentry question="I would like to create 1000 copies of a digital asset movie on elastos. The movie will have a unique ID stored in the DID side chain. Suppose that one user wants to sell the movie: 1) is the file’s copy from the same physically different from each other? (Mean that do we need to download the exact specific file from the seller’s device?). Or each copy is the same exact file (so everyone can download it but only few who have ownership via DID can watch the movie). 2) how can the user download the file after he bought it if the seller doesn’t have any IPFS or private cloud space? 3) when I want to see the downloaded movie, DID verification will launch first. So is it possible to launch the movie without internet? 4) where can he sell the movie? if we have something like a market place, does it act like a central place/ middle man and have the mopopoly (with restrictons/ fees.. ) ?" %}}

1) Each copy of a movie is an actual APPLICATION. It's NOT an .mp4 file or whatever. It's an actual application so you're selling application from one person to another. Each application has a unique ID and when the author first creates those 1000 copies, all the IDs along with ownership are already recorded on the blockchain and stored on IPFS

2) The user can't download the file. He has to buy it from someone else same as buying bitcoin but buying an application in this case. The content of that movie is already stored on IPFS

3) Not possible. The application cannot check your DID unless it's connected to the internet as it needs to connect to the blockchain since that's where DID is stored

4) Like a digital market place like a DEX but for movies

{{% faqentry question="In order for a transation to be effective, user needs to download the whole app file. So what happens if the app is huge like 1GB? Does the seller need to wait for the user to finish his download to receive money? What happen if we lose our application movie: eg by deleting it from the computer to get more space?" %}}

It's like downloading an app on your mobile phone right now. When you go to your app, is the data on facebook really stored on your own device? Nope. You just download the app and this app contains the code to check the ID and ownership of this app. The data is stored in the IPFS. If you lose your application, you just use your private key to access your app again. That is what your ownership is tied with. Just like restoring your online wallet.

{{% faqentry question="Selling ownership and downloading data will be a 2 step process like buying an app on appstore : first pay for the ownership and second download the dapp. So with IPFS and elastos is it possible to be run out of seeders?" %}}

Theoretically yea, it's possible. But even that tv box is already in over 230,000 hands and all of them can be utilized to be part of the IPFS network. Imagine when IoeX starts selling their smart speakers. Or you can also run your own node and be part of the IPFS network in the future. I doubt we;ll ever run out of seeders at this rate.
