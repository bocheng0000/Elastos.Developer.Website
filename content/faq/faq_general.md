{{% faqentry question="Who are Elastos’s competitors at the moment? And what makes Elastos different from others?" %}}
EOS is called a blockchain operation system, but its development period and open source codes are much shorter than Elastos’ 17 years. Also, EOS is dependent on its main-chain, so no matter how optimized it becomes, its throughput is limited. Elastos can extend the throughput infinitely with flexible main-chain and side-chain solution. Meanwhile, Elastos Runtime can deliver the trust function of the blockchain to a user’s application (like a cell phone, laptop, etc), which applies the blockchain to various scenarios in daily life.

{{% faqentry question="What will be the future application cases in Elastos?" %}}
Because our vision is to provide users with a trustful operating system based on their application scenarios and as well as on blockchain technology, we will definitely have a lot of potential future applications.

The followings are some example of the applications:

* Support point-to-point conversation, point-to-point document transfer through decentralized P2P communication.
* Support point-to-point business through decentralized payment.
* Support digital content APP, like: electronic books, games, video player. All digital assets can be protected in a trustful environment.
* Support applications about evidence, traceability to source, ID verification, etc. through trustful storage.

Our projects that are currently in the business phase include: automatic driving system for one of China’s top automobile company, point-to-point document transfer system in personal mobile phones, evidence for credit investigation, single ID verification platform, and traceability of luxury goods.

{{% faqentry question="Did anybody ask the similarity and difference between Elastos and blockstack?" %}}
Blockstack realizes a decentralized browser based on distributed storage, and supply applications depending on browser. It combines encrypted, distributed storage and blockchain ID to make sure all the data belongs to the owner.

As for Elastos, we will apply a similar method for digital assets storage. Users could apply for an ID for their digital assets on the blockchain, which guarantees the ownership of those digital contents. Based on the clarification of ownership, the digital contents will also be transferable and tradable. Finally, we make sure that all the digital contents can be used in trustful environment by the Elastos Runtime. Even though it is decrypted, it cannot escape from Elastos Runtime operating environment, which guarantees that it will never disclose or damage the ownership of the digital contents.
