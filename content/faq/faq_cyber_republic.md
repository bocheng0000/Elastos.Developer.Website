{{% faqentry question="Is the Cyber Republic a political party or a political entity?" %}}
No. The Cyber Republic has its own constitution and will have its own voting system and governance system but there is no political side to it. It will manage itself without any control by the Elastos foundation. It will be autonomous.

{{% faqentry question="Will one person have the power to control the whole project?" %}}
Just as the ELA blockchain wants to be as decentralized as Bitcoin and maintain the same ideology, the founders of the Cyber Republic  want the same: decentralized on every level. Nor the founder Rong Chen, nor the foundation has all the power.
