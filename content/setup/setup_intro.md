To start building apps on Elastos, you have to setup 2 parts. 

### The environment

The first one is the **environment**: install development tools, run a testnet, create test ELA, and more. But don't worry, we tried to make this as easy as possible for you.

### Your project

The second part is **client** specific, in order to get your actual android/ios/web/etc project ready to call Elastos APIs.
