By default, testnet is the active network after installing Elastos. The whole Elastos ecosystem is ready to be used. But you need to go through a few steps to get things ready, such as creating your initial wallets and getting test ELAs:

## Creating a new test wallet

{{% highlight "shell" %}}
$ elastos-cli wallet create (?)
{{% /highlight %}}

## Getting more test ELA

{{% highlight "shell" %}}
$ elastos-cli wallet ela add (?)
{{% /highlight %}}
