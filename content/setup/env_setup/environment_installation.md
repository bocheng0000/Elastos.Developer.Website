{{< todo "Can we have a oneliner to install the privnet, also checking/installing missing tools at the same time? Can ela-cli be responsible for this (ex: first install the CLI, then run a cli command to setup the whole privnet automatically with shell interaction if needed?)" >}}

{{< todo "The purpose here is to make everything transparent for app developers. Easy to setup, then immediatelly start calling APIs from their target platform (android, web, trinity, etc). No curl test command. And switching from privnet to live net should be done from the client project, simply by switching a property, and from that switch, libs will talk to privnet or live net" >}}
