# Elastos documentation

{{< youtube vaJ5Pguxd4M  >}}

Welcome! You are probably here because you heard about Elastos and want to know what this is about, or you already know Elastos and you're looking for more advanced answers or APIs.

Here is where you can start:

## Discover

Just arrived? Not sure what Elastos is yet? Make sure to read {{< internallink "what is Elastos?" "discover_elastos/what_is_elastos/_index.md" >}} to get some background.

## Start with Elastos

* App developer
    * {{< internallink "Setup Elastos core services" "get_started/setup/setup_intro.md" >}} first (you **don't** need to read the Elastos blockchain section yet if you're new to Elastos), then try a few {{< internallink "samples" "elastos_core_services/samples/_index.md">}} and start reading our {{< internallink "core services guides" "elastos_core_services/guides/_index.md" >}}.
* Miner
    * {{< internallink "Mine ELA" "elastos_blockchain/connect_to_elastos/mine_and_secure/merged_mining.md" >}}
    * {{< internallink "Run your own supernode" "elastos_blockchain/connect_to_elastos/mine_and_secure/supernode.md" >}}
* Crypto exchange
    * {{< internallink "Connect to the ELA main chain" "elastos_blockchain/connect_to_elastos/exchanges/_index.md" >}}

More advanced Elastos developers may want to directly talk to the Elastos mainchain and sidechains through RPC calls. The {{< internallink "Elastos blockchain section" "/elastos_blockchain/_index.md">}} is a good starting point.

## Contribute
So you love Elastos and would like to bring your best skills to make it even better? Here is how to {{< internallink "contribute to the platform" "contribute/_index.md" >}}  with hundreds of other great developers.
