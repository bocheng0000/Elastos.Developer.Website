## Testnet setup

**What is testnet?** This is a clone of mainnet (the "prod" environment), where you can test your apps before releasing them, use test ELAs instead of real ELAs during development phase, test smart contracts more easily, with faster block times, etc.

By default, the active network is testnet. You can go on with the {{< internallink "testnet configuration page" "testnet_config.md" >}} to start creating your first wallet and get a few test ELAs. 

Right after that, you can start {{< internallink "getting your application ready" "elastos_core_services/setup/project_setup/_index.md" >}} and start using Elastos APIs!
