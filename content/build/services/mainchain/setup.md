## Building the ELA Node

{{< hero >}}
    {{< heroitem link="https://github.com/elastos/elastos.ELA" linkBlank="true" rightArrow="true">}}
        Our Elastos (ELA) Node is open-source on Github, you can build and deploy it yourself and 
        directly connect it to our vast Elastos blockchain network.

## Using the ELA CLI

The {{< internallink "ELA CLI" "/build/services/mainchain/guides/ela_cli.md" >}} is a command line interface that helps you talk to a ELA (mainchain) node.

This tool is built at the same time as the ELA node (make command). You can find more details at our Github repo [https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.ELA.Client](https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.ELA.Client).

Here are a few base features for this tool:

* ELA mainchain transactions
* Mainchain to sidechains ELA transactions

## Note

This tool is not intended to be used by regular application developers in the future. Short term, it can help transferring ELA among the Elastos chains, but this is a process that will be automatized in a near future.
