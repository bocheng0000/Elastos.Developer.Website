## Contract Interaction

There are 3 general ways to interact with your smart contracts:

#### Navigation

{{< hero >}}
    {{< heroitem title="CLI Console Interaction" link="/build/dapps/tutorials/interaction/cli">}}
        Developing locally, a console is a quick way to connect to your smart contracts and manually initiate any 
        functions on the smart contract. 
    {{< /heroitem >}}
    
    {{< heroitem title="Scripting & Test Interaction" active="true">}}
        From a secure environment where you can safely expose your private keys you can script or write tests for
        your local PrivNet, TestNet or even MainNet.

    {{< heroitem title="Client-Side dApps" link="/build/dapps/tutorials/interaction/client">}}
        For deployed client-side dApps, all your code is public so the expectation is that users bring their own
        private keys via a secure browser extension such as Metamask. You would also use your own Metamask to
        test the experience.
