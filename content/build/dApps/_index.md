Of course you are free to build **Decentralized Applications** in any way you'd like.
 
##### **elastOS** is convenient because it: 

- Enforces a set of security principles to **better protect user's data and privacy**

- Promotes using decentralized services over centralized ones 

- Offers a standardized plugin architecture and tools to make development easier

##### But it does have its restrictions, namely:

- All external data requests/connections must be whitelisted and approved by users

- All capsules/dApps must be written using the Ionic Framework

- Users need to download the elastOS app first and your dApp exists within another app 

##### What if you only want to use some components of Elastos? 

#### {{< rawhtml >}}<u>By all means we would love that!</u>{{< /rawhtml >}}

Elastos is non-profit and its ecosystem is an open-source platform developed for the public with a common goal to
create a better digital economy and world.

### Feel free to explore the Elastos ecosystem and figure out what works for you:
