### Very Short Summary
Elastos solves the trilemma of all blockchain projects out there - the problem of security using the trusted runtime environment, scalability using the main chain sidechains solutions and decentralization using the peer to peer network.

### Short Summary
Elastos is the safe and reliable internet of the future. Built utilizing the blockchain, this technological breakthrough provides the first completely safe environment on the web where decentralized applications are detached from the internet while also permitting full scalability to billions of users. Elastos enables the generation of wealth through ownership and exchange of your data and digital assets.

### Summary
Elastos is not a blockchain project but rather a network operating system project powered by blockchain technology so in that sense, Elastos is not directly competing with any other blockchain projects. It can work together with them to form this new ecosystem where the decentralized applications run directly on the device instead of running on the blockchain along with decentralized peer to peer network to transfer assets in a completely closed sandboxed environment, thereby solving the trilemma of blockchain projects - security, scalability, and decentralization.

### Long Summary
Elastos uses internet as the base-layer infrastructure rather than an application where decentralized applications are forced to never directly connect to the internet and only interact with Elastos runtime(which in turn acts as a middle layer, then connecting to the internet). Within the elastos ecosystem, everything from devices to virtual machines to users to DApps have a DID(Decentralized ID) issued by the blockchain and everytime the application requests any sort of internet access, the ID has to first be verified using the blockchain which in turn eliminates many of the man-in-the-middle attacks, virus attacks, etc

Elastos is not a typical operating system. Usually, when you think about operating systems, you think about a device operating system that is tied to a particular device. Elastos is not a device OS but rather it’s a network OS. This means the network is the computer instead of device being the computer. This also means that this operating system will never need to be upgraded because the network has no version. It’s just the network. The internet has no version. It’s just the internet. The internet gets upgraded by adding services on top of it and people using those services. Similarly, the elastos network OS gets upgraded when someone adds a new service and people start using this service. There is no human intervention required as everything is code and everything is autonomous and self running. The elastos network operating system is literally a world supercomputer formed of millions and millions of virtual machines spread across the internet where your data might be stored in your own personal drive or Elastos Hive(a version of IPFS which is distributed across the internet). In that sense, every device on the internet will be able to recognize elastos because the internet itself is the device.
