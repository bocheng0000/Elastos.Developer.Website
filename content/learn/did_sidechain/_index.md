Elastos provides a set of identity management tools that are 
{{< externallink title="W3C DID Compliant" >}}https://w3c.github.io/did-core{{< /externallink >}}
and enable you to build applications that use the new global **Decentralized Identifiers (DID)** standard for identity.
 
A Decentralized Identifier (DID) refers to an ID that can be issued by an autonomous, independent, and decentralized 
platform that acts as a proof of ownership of digital identity.

### Decentralized IDs (DIDs)

The DID (Decentralized Identifier) Sidechain issues completely decentralized IDs to users, apps, and devices that are 
not controlled by any individual or third party. DID is an autonomous and secure identification system.

### Bring Data Ownership Back to its Owners

By issuing Universal IDs (UIDs) to everyone on the internet, a blockchain automates trust. In a blockchain-based 
system of exchange, transactions occur only between individuals, thereby dissolving central authorities and intermediaries.

### Tamper-Proof, Interoperable Identification for Everyone

Todayâ€™s internet is dominated by large companies that make you log in with their in-house logins to access your data. 
An open source Universal ID (UID) system like Elastos DID allows you to trust code not corporations controlling your data.

### Elastos DID Sidechain

On Elastos the DID Sidechain employs a PoW consensus and is merged-mined with ELA allowing it to leverage the same 
security and hashpower provided to the Elastos Mainchain by the Bitcoin network.

### Live Since July 2018

Officially going live in July 2018, the DID Sidechain was the first sidechain to launch on Elastos. It plays a vital 
role in enabling enterprises and digital platforms to issue universal DIDs to individuals, applications, and devices on the internet.
