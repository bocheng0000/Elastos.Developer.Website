##### As a member of the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), Elastos maintains a dedicated blockchain to support a W3C-compliant DID implementation.

#### W3C DID Specification: <b><a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core" target="_blank" onclick="event.stopPropagation();">https://w3c.github.io/did-core</a></b>

The Elastos ecosystem includes a dedicated blockchain to provide the essential functions of DIDs. By using a dedicated 
sidechain, we ensure the highest possible availability of the critical identity data required by dApps and products on Elastos.

Recognizing the importance of self-sovereign identities and the global movement to a standardized decentralized identity 
model, the Elastos Foundation has joined the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) and dedicated significant resources 
to ensure that its DID services follow the W3C Decentralized Identifier (DID) specification.
