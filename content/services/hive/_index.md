##### A flexible, decentralized storage solution. 

Data storage is a ubiquitous requirement of virtually every application, and, historically speaking, decentralized solutions have seen limited improvements beyond the widely accepted IPFS solution. Elastos is building a more flexible decentralized storage solution with swappable storage constructs allowing private storage and public decentralized storage behind robust Swift/Java SDKS for mobile devices.

Elastos Hive can be better likened to an interface than an actual storage service in that it allows developers to choose from numerous storage services which contain IPFS (Interplanetary File System) and Microsoft Onedrive, among others. The idea behind Hive is to provide developers with the choice of which storage service to use so they do not become dependent on a singular storage solution. Developers can decide to connect their apps to IPFS, Onedrive, or any other storage services supported by Hive in the future.

Furthermore, whereas Hive is used directly by developers, Hive++, which is an upgraded and advanced version of Hive, allows users to directly select a storage service from any application. Instead of developers choosing a solution for the users, users can decide to choose the solution for themselves, where they can decide to use their own personal computer as their cloud drive or use other community-run nodes known as Vaults  for their storage solution. Most importantly, Hive++ brings the capability of DID to the storage layer, where control and accessibility to shared data is decided by the users themselves. In other words, users can store data on Vaults and control who can view their data and who cannot. Such a revolutionary mechanism establishes a new standard of self-ownership that is presently unrivaled across the blockchain space.
