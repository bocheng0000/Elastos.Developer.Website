### Elastos documentation

# Samples & Demos

Try our sample apps before coding to get familiar with Elastos.


{{< todo "Check the following demo list provided by TangZhiLong and see which ones we want to keep or rework. For all samples that don't target developers, consider creating a 'samples' page in 'contributes', to help contributors plqying with those things before coding." >}}

1. elashell   -- Elastos.NET.Carrier.Native.SDK/apps/shell.  A shell to demonstrate all kinds commands related to carrier APIs.
2. elapfd.    -- Elastos.NET.Carrier.Native.SDK/apps/pfd. A port forwarding example
3. filetransfer   -- Elastos.NET.Carrier.Native.SDK/apps/file. A file transfer example.
4. (probably keep - check if code is up to date) Filetransfer — Elastos.NEt.Carrier.Demo.Filetransfer.Android. And android demo to make file transfer between peers.
5. Remoter — Elastos.NET.Carrier.Demo.Remoter.iOS . An IoT scenario simulated samples.
6. (on github only - for contributors?) FuseApp - Elastos.NET.Hive.Demo.FuseApp. An demo mapping IFPS as filesystem.
